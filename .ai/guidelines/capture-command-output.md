## Always Capture Command Output

Append `|| true` to all verification commands (tests, linting, type checks) so the output is always captured, even on failure. Without it, a non-zero exit code can hide the output, forcing an expensive second run just to read the errors.

```bash
# CORRECT — output always visible
vendor/bin/pest --filter=testName || true
vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent || true

# WRONG — output lost on failure, wastes time re-running
vendor/bin/pest --filter=testName
```
